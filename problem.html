    <p class="problem">Fast fashion is certainly fast and easy for the short-term, but harmful to our Earth in the long-term. The term, “fast fashion” refers to a business model in which corporations mass produce inexpensive clothing to keep up with the trends, earning high profits usually due to exploitative labor practices. Fast fashion and the companies which perpetuate it has recently been on a rapid rise over the past decade, and it’s creating a multitude of human safety and environmental concerns in all aspects of its supply chain. With the rise of social media and the internet, fashion trends are coming and going at faster rates, and with it the pressure to keep buying and consuming products. Online shopping culture has also made it more convenient to buy clothes at a higher frequency and with more ease than ever before. Unfortunately, buying more than you need has the consequence of more waste. </p
<br>
<p class="problem">It is such a large amount of waste that, “approximately 85% of the clothing Americans consume, nearly 3.8 billion pounds annually, is sent to landfills as solid waste, amounting to nearly 80 pounds per American per year” (Bick). Much of that clothing waste is not made of sustainable material, instead it is made of synthetic fabric which is not biodegradable. A large chunk of that unrecyclable clothing gets left in the landfill, exacerbating the amount of pollution and CO2 released into the atmosphere. It is not just the environmental cost that fast fashion leaves, but also the human cost. Workers work long hours with limited pay under unsafe conditions. Overall, fast fashion is one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gas emissions, depleting non-renewable resources at an unsettling rate, and without intervention, will continue to accelerate our current climate crisis.</p>
